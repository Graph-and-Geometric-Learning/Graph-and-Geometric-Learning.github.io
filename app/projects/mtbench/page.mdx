## Introduction

News influences the world around us—from stock markets reacting to financial reports to temperature trends following extreme weather events. However, understanding this impact is not straightforward. While AI models are improving at handling both text and numbers, most datasets fail to test how well they connect these different types of data.

To address this, we introduce  **MTBench** (**M**ultimodal **T**ime Series **Bench**mark), a dataset designed to evaluate how well AI models understand the relationship between text and time-series data. MTBench pairs financial news with stock market movements and weather reports with historical temperature changes. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on text or numbers separately, MTBench challenges models to analyze both together, helping to assess their ability to detect trends, interpret news, and make predictions.

- **Finance**: 200K+ news articles with stock movements from 2021–2023.
- **Weather**: Historical temperature trends covering nearly two decades with reports of extreme events.

We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on MTBench to measure their ability to link news with data trends (see our **Leaderboard**). The results reveal key challenges—models struggle with long-term pattern recognition, cause-and-effect relationships, and seamlessly combining insights from text and numbers.
