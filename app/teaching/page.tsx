      "This course provides an introduction to machine learning algorithms designed for graph-structured data, such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and molecular structures. The course covers key graph representation learning techniques, such as node embeddings, graph neural networks, deep generative models for graphs, and non-Euclidean embeddings and other practical topics like AutoML and explainability in graph learning. We also explore applications of graph machine learning, showing how to model and apply graph learning techniques to areas such as online recommender systems, knowledge graphs, biological networks, and physical simulations.",
